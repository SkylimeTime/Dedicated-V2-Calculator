# TT-Damage-Calculator
 Gag damage calculator for [Toontown Rewritten](https://toontownrewritten.com/).

![The Program](https://github.com/Vhou-Atroph/TT-Damage-Calculator/blob/main/preview.png?raw=true)

# Usage
**Gag Selection**

Click any gag on the grid to add it to the calculation. 

**Statuses/Modifiers**

Buttons are available above the grid, allowing you to factor in things on calculation, such as a cog being lured that round, organic gags, and cog defense level. Lure and/or Defense can be locked in with the Lock menu, preventing them from resetting when the user clicks on the 'Reset Damage' button. When the organic button is pressed, every gag added subsequently will be calculated as organic. This will be indicated by every gag button turning orange, as well as a text indicator under the calculated damage. Click again to disable this.  

**Other Features**

There are three buttons in the bottom right corner of the program.  
'Clear History' will clear all text in the History panel, which logs previous calculations.  
'Pin to Top' will ensure the program is always on top and visible.  
'Show Health and SOS Cards' brings up a grid of all cog health values from Level 7 to Level 20, as well as the major SOS cards for Trap, Sound, and Drop.  
The latter two buttons can both be toggled off by pressing them a second time.  

The program has various keybinds to expedite calculation:
| Keybind     | Description       |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| shift       | Toggle Organic    |
| ctrl+d      | Toggle Defense    |
| ctrl+l      | Toggle Lure       |
| ctrl+r      | Reset Calculation |
