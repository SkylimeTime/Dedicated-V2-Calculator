# Dedicated-V2-Damage-Calculator
An alternative version of the TT-Damage-Calculator found [here](https://github.com/Vhou-Atroph/TT-Damage-Calculator)  
Please check the original readme for more information
 
This version is designed to only calculate damages for the four available levels of version 2.0 Cogs in Toontown Rewritten (9-12)  
Many of the original features are not present as a result, but calculator operation is mostly identical  
This version is NOT a replacement or upgrade. DO NOT replace any of the original files  
Save this version in a separate directory if you wish to use this  
 
This version also fixes a calculation bug relating to teamwork damage with low level gags on 2.0 Cogs. Check the "differences_from_original.txt" file for an in depth description  
 
Before anyone says anything, I am aware the code here is sloppy and poorly made  
This is intended as a temporary solution and proof of concept, so the approaches made are very volatile and poor practice. Do not use this as example of good code  

# TOMLI INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
